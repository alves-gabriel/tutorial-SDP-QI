# Semidefinite Programming for Quantum Information

A simple jupyter-lab notebook for SDPs in Quantum Information science. Please follow the installation instructions therein and run the CSS cell. Ideally the notebook should be opened on jupyter-_lab_ locally (and in light mode!), since the formatting will not work well if the notebook is visualized directly through github. Unfortunately using jupyter notebook instead of jupyter-lab also breaks down the formatting for some equations and examples.
