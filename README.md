# Semidefinite Programming for Quantum Information

A simple jupyter-lab notebook for SDPs in Quantum Information science. Please follow the installation instructions therein. Ideally the notebook should be opened on jupyter-_lab_ locally (and in light mode!), since the formatting will not work well if the notebook is visualized directly through github.
